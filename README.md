# UI Developer Assessment

In this assessment you will show your abilities and experience with regards to integrating modern technologies like React with an old codebase that uses MooTools.

Deep knowledge of MooTools is not necessary to complete this assignment but knowledge of similar libraries from the same era (like JQuery) will help.

## Assignment

The index.html page renders a very simple MooTools-based web component with 3 buttons and a div. When the buttons are clicked, they update the div's text.

### Main goal

1. Build a modern UI component and render it in the `id="new"` div, it should do the following:
  1. Update when any of the buttons on the old component are clicked
  2. Have a button of it's own that when clicked updates something in the old component (bi-directional communication), using object oriented programming
2. Add a second React component to the page, it's functionality is up to you

### Requirements

- Complete the main goal using React and TypeScript
- Provide a git repository with your solution using link to a publicly accessible repository.
- Changes to index.html should be minimal: it is a proxy for one of the many pages in our platform.

#### Extra credits

If time allows, add unit testing to the new React code.

## Delivery

- Create a new repository with the initial code and build your solution on top of it
  - Add a README-IMPLEMENTED.md with any details necessary
- Once the solution is built, send your solution to your hiring contact
- Please deliver the solution within 14 days of receiving this assessment
